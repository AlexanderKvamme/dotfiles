# Info

Checklist to remember:

- Clone the dotfiles project to ~/ and rename it from dotfiles to .dotfiles
- Use bash shell, so switch from Zsh in terminal
- Follow the brew install command's messages about including a proper path so that the terminal can find Homebrew. If it cant, it will result in error messages where it cant find the command 'brew' after having installed it
